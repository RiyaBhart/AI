# Question 1:
## Objections that still carry weight:
1.	Mathematical objection: there are some truths that the human mind can think of, but machines cannot.
2.	Consciousness: machines do not have self-awareness and subjective experiences.
3.	Program restricted: machines only perform what they are programmed to do, they cannot do anything further.
4.	Way of doing: human mind operates differently from digital computers.
## Validity of Refutations:
1.	Mathematical objection: Humans do make mistakes, while ai still struggles with logical reasoning and common sense, where humans excel.
2.	Conscious objection: turning dismisses the importance of subjective experience in intelligence.
3.	Program restricted objection: argued that machines could learn and evolve, which is partially valid. However, the creativity part remains debated.
## New objections:
1.	Ethical problem: where humans do think what is ethical and unethical machines do not worry about unethical means that may be harmful to society.
2.	Emotional aspect: human minds, before performing some high-level tasks, thinks of the consequences people might have emotionally whereas machines still fail to do that.
3.	Control Problem: humans can be controlled after reaching a certain point where they get harmed but controlling machines once you train them is a safety concern.
## Prediction for 2000:
Turing predicted that by 2000, a machine would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. While this prediction captured the potential for AI advancements, it underestimated the complexities of human-like reasoning and understanding.
Although chatbots today can mimic human conversation convincingly, they still fall short in true comprehension, adaptability, and abstract thought.

# Question 2:
1.	If we talk about computers in such a way that robots are also computers so yes, a game of table tennis can be played by computers. In this era everything is possible, and computers are so intelligent and accurate that playing a table tennis game isn’t difficult.
2.	Yes, if a computer can be that intelligent to play games like go and defeat human mind then it surely can play a game of bridge at competitive level.
3.	Yes
4.	If the computer is taught about all books and rules of law beforehand, then yes. But it is better to consult someone that has feelings and can think about the law critically. 
5.	Yes Feasible
6.	Yes, today there are many robots performing surgeries all over the world. Even in Pakistan there was a robot at Jinnah Hospital to conduct surgery to treat diabetes and obesity. 
7.	No, not feasible, kitchens are always made differently everywhere and to guess the kitchen’s infrastructure and then the dishes are difficult at this level.
8.	Yes, partially feasible, if the robot is taught all about building it would surely build it under human supervision. It would be a complex job, but I think it could be achieved.

# Question 3:
## Domain: AI-Powered Trendy Video Editor
## Functionalities:
Trend Detection: The AI automatically scans social media (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts) to find trending sounds, effects, and video styles.
Smart Editing: It analyses raw footage and applies trendy cuts, transitions, and filters based on popular editing patterns.
Auto Sync to Music: Matches clips to beat drops and highlights based on viral trends.
AI Effects & Captions: Adds animated text, subtitles, and effects dynamically.
Content Personalization: Learns from the user’s editing preferences and adapts suggestions over time.
Automated Posting & Hashtag Suggestions: Recommends the best time to post and generates engaging captions & hashtags.

## Characterizing the Environment:
### Feature	                   Type
Accessible?	No (Trends constantly change, requiring external data collection)
Deterministic?	 No (Editing choices vary based on trends and AI learning)
Episodic?	Yes (Each video project is separate)
Static?	No (Trends change daily, requiring dynamic adaptation)
Continuous?	Yes (AI continuously learns and updates itself)

## Best Agent Architecture:
Machine Learning & Deep Learning – For identifying trends, suggesting edits, and auto-syncing videos.
Computer Vision & NLP – For analysing video content and generating captions.
Reinforcement Learning – For improving recommendations based on user feedback.
Web Scraping & API Integration – For fetching real-time trend data from social media.

# Question 4:
1.	False, agents can still be rational even when they have partial information, that is the specialty of agents that they can predict a lot based on certain sample and make accurate decisions.
2.	True, an environment where the consequences and history of percepts should be kept in mind, a reflex agent won’t be able to work its best at that time.
3.	True, an environment where all the agents are getting the same outcome, every agent is rational because they cannot perform better than others.
4.	False, agent program and agent function are two different things, agent program’s input is the current percept, while agent function’s input is percept history.
5.	False, not all tasks can be implemented by computers.
6.	True, if all actions lead to the same results, then yes.
7.	True, it is possible where the requirements or behavior aligns with the optimal policy.
